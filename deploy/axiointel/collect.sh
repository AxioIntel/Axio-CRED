# Collect the places AxioIntel is watching with the Axio-CRED collector, and send them back.
#
# Runs on the collector's own machine, which must have no link to AxioIntel's Google Cloud
# project: its own provider account, its own IP addresses. fetch_targets.py asks AxioIntel which
# places to collect; a list kept here instead goes stale the moment a workspace watches something
# new. For each place, with the same arguments Axio-CRED's app uses for an exact Place ID, the
# collector opens the public Google Maps listing, collects its reviews, and writes JSON lines.
# push_native.py signs what came back and posts it to /api/ingest/native. Both programs are
# AxioIntel's, fetched from Axio-Backend's scripts/ so they cannot drift from the endpoints they
# talk to. Nothing here reports, flags or appeals anything.
#
# Since 26 Sep 2026 this collector is AxioIntel's first source of reviews, and Apify its backup
# (owner's decision). AxioIntel asks for a place by marking it requested; the daemon below polls
# for requests every two minutes, so a person's "Pull now" is answered in minutes. AxioIntel
# falls back to Apify by itself when a request waits over 15 minutes or this collector slows down.
#
# Modes:
#   lab    (default) collect the places file given, keep every result on this machine, and add one
#          line per place to <work>/lab/summary.csv. AxioIntel is neither asked nor sent anything,
#          and no secret is needed.
#   send   ask AxioIntel what to collect, send each collection back (and write the same summary line).
#
# Usage: collect.sh [places-file]      one pass: the file given, or (send mode) AxioIntel's list
#        collect.sh daemon             send mode, forever: poll for requested and due places and
#                                      collect up to COLLECTOR_PARALLEL of them at once
#        collect.sh install-daemon     install and start the systemd service that runs `daemon`
#        collect.sh status             the service, and the last 20 summary lines
#
# Configuration, from /etc/axiointel/collector.env (root-owned, mode 600) or the environment:
#   COLLECTOR_MODE                   lab (default) or send; `daemon` requires send
#   AXIOINTEL_NATIVE_INGEST_SECRET   the shared secret; required in send mode only
#   AXIOINTEL_BASE_URL               which deployment to ask and send to; default
#                                    https://axiointel.com/api -- point it at staging for a first run
#   AXIOINTEL_TARGETS_URL            overrides only where the list comes from
#   AXIOINTEL_INGEST_URL             overrides only where collections are sent
#   COLLECTOR_PLACES_FILE            collect this list instead of asking AxioIntel (one pass only)
#   COLLECTOR_IMAGE                  docker image built from this repository; default axio-cred-collector
#   COLLECTOR_PROXIES_FILE           optional; one proxy URL per line, passed as -proxies-file
#   COLLECTOR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS        per place; default 900, inside AxioIntel's 15-minute wait. The
#                                    collector's own review clock (-review-budget) is set four minutes
#                                    under it, so a slow place is written out partial rather than killed
#                                    and lost; a partial collection is finished by a later pass.
#   COLLECTOR_PARALLEL               daemon: places collected at once; default 3
#   COLLECTOR_POLL_SECONDS           daemon: how often AxioIntel is asked; default 120
#   COLLECTOR_MIN_INTERVAL_HOURS     daemon: a place that is due but not requested is collected at
#                                    most this often; default 6
#   COLLECTOR_RETRY_MINUTES          daemon: a place whose last try failed waits this long; default 10
#   COLLECTOR_WORK_DIR               default /var/lib/axiointel-collector
#   COLLECTOR_KEEP_DAYS              local results kept this long; default 14
#
# Exit status (one pass): 0 when every place was collected and sent; 1 when the list could not be
# fetched, or when any place was not.
